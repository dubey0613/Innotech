                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <h5>Connect <span>and Aspire</span></h5>
                    <p>Our major aim is to connect the students with each other according to their technical skills.</p>

                        <p>In today's technical world it is very important for the students to participate in different technical competitions such as hackathons but it is very hard to find the teammates to form a team for the competitions.</p>
                        
                        <p>So, We at KIET Connect work for this issue, we've created a platform for the students of our college where they can find the fellow students who are available for the competitions and they can filter out the results according to their required skills.</p>
                        
                        <p>Students will register on the platform and will enter the skills known to them so other students on the platform can connect with them for various reasons such as team formation or collaborative learning, etc.</p>
